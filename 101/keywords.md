```shell
break     default      func    interface  select
case      defer        go      map        struct
chan      else         goto    package    switch
const     fallthrough  if      range      type
continue  for          import  return     var
```

They can be categorized as four groups:
- const, func, import, package, type and var are used to declare all kinds of code elements in Go programs.
- chan, interface, map and struct are used as parts in some composite type denotations.
- break, case, continue, default, else, fallthrough, for, goto, if, range, return, select and switch are used to control flow of code.
- defer and go are also control flow keywords, but in other specific manners. They modify function calls, which we'll talk about in this article.
